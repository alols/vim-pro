vimpro

Author: Albin Olsson

This scripts adds the concept of projects to Vim. It was written with
software projects in mind, but might be useful for other purposes as well.
It comes with the following features:

	* Automatic tag management, add your files to the project and tags
	  will *just work*.
	* A project-wide grep command that makes it easy to search for
	  occurrences inside project files.
	* An equivalent of :e that makes it very easy to open files
	  belonging to the project
	* It is very easy to add files to the project

TODO:
Add settings for ctags command line
Make project file format expandable for the future
Handle if ctags executable is missing
Handle if a project is loaded that is not a project
Make the grep match highlight optional
Add cscope support
