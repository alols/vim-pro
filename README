Automatically updates tags when saving and provides a project-wide grep
command.

Summary

:Pload {file}
        Open or create new project.
        When a file is written it is automatically added to the project.
        Tags are automatically updated for all project files.

:Punload
        Unload project. (It is never necessary to call this function)

:Padd {file}
        Manually add a file to project.
        Examples:
            :Padd %
                Add current file
            :Padd **/*.c **/*.h
                Recursively add all .c and .h files in current directory and
                subdirectories.

:Prm {file}
        Remove file from project.

:Pgrep /{pattern}/[g][j]
        Perform a vim-grep in all project files.

:Pe {file}
        Like :e, only :Pe tab-completes the filename with files
        belonging to the project.

:Pls
        Fill quickfix list with all project files.
        Entries are for line number 1 unless the file is loaded. If the
        file is loaded the entry is for the line the cursor is on in the
        buffer.

:Pdo
        Perform command on all project files. EXPERIMENTAL.
        Example:
            :Pdo e
                Open all project files
